## Background

This is a little game when I was leaning Js, CSS, and HTML5. It did not use any framework, but just basic grammar.

## Install

You just need to clone it to local. 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Eugene-Song/minesweeper.git
```

## Usage

You can use any IDE to open it, or you can run index.html with any brower. This game is even compatiable to IE.
